There are many Linux distributions. This article explains my own thinking on why [Serpent OS](https://serpentos.com/) may be one of the most significant technical projects today. And is also a good Linux distribution.

Git revolutionised source control by combining several existing ideas _and_ being easy to adopt. The capabilities that it provided then moved from being unusual to being standards. Serpent OS may do something similar for operating systems.

## What?

The core of Serpent OS is a set of tools and services that are designed from the ground up to enable a healthy, free-flowing software ecosystem that spans from developers to the users and their computers.

A number of Linux distributions build technologies to try to accomplish the safe and rapid distribution of software. They apply concepts like rolling releases and immutable systems to enable developers to continuously release new software packages that can be installed on existing systems.

The key difference is that Serpent OS tooling is carefully designed to make this a _good experience for everyone_. Everything from the choices of the programming languages and file formats that distribution maintainers work with to the tools for users to upgrade their systems are focused on enabling people to work quickly, safely and with confidence.

These Serpent OS tools are integrated into the Linux distribution called Serpent OS. This is intended to be both a testing ground for the Serpent OS tools and a high-quality operating system for software developers.

The Serpent OS tooling is also specifically designed to be reused by other teams to create their own Linux distibutions, and enable these distribution teams to continuously collaborate. Today, many of the most popular Linux distributions rely on other distributions to provide them with the tools and package definitions that they need, but the technologies that they share were not designed to support this kind of reuse. In future Solus, Serpent OS and other distributions that use this tooling will be able to quickly and routinely share their work.

## Why does this matter?

The short answer is that it might make your life a little better. If you rely on computers, it matters that the systems that you use will respond to your needs, and are also trustworthy. To have confidence, you need systems that are both easy to operate and transparent. That confidence is built from many small things, and can also be spoiled by even a small number of decisions by the software maintainers that you rely on.

The design of Serpent OS tooling makes it easy for developers to get the small things right, and enables multiple teams of developers to efficiently maintain operating systems that are tailored to suit the needs of particular users. If Serpent OS does not meet your needs, you can use Solus or another distribution and still benefit from the same technologies.

The big-picture is that we need to be able to update our systems faster and with more confidence than ever before. Old software has become unsafe software as the rate of new security vulnerabilities increases. We can also expect to have go through large transitions as we replace some of the software and hardware that we currently use with other products that are safer and more efficient by design.
