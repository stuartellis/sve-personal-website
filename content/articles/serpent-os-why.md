> This article is my personal viewpoint, based on following and sponsoring the Serpent OS project. This article is not an official position of the Serpent OS developers or my employer.

There are many Linux distributions. This article explains my own thinking on why [Serpent OS](https://serpentos.com/) may be one of the most significant technical projects today. And is also likely to become a very good Linux distribution.

Git revolutionised source control by combining several existing ideas _and_ being easy to adopt. The capabilities that it provided then moved from being unusual to becoming standards. Serpent OS may do something similar for operating systems.

## So, what is Serpent OS?

Serpent OS is two things:

- The tools that are needed to maintain a Linux distribution
- A Linux distribution that uses the Serpent OS tools

The key point is this:

_Serpent OS technology is designed from the ground up to empower people to work quickly, safely and with confidence._

The distinctive feature of Serpent OS is that the tooling is carefully designed to make the experiences of collaboration and updating enjoyable for everyone in an open ecosystem. It uses modern technologies such as Rust and works to high standards of engineering, but the aim is to produce systems that people will _want_ to keep using and developing because they are safe, fast, and productive.

This underlying aim applies to every aspect, from the choices of the programming languages and file formats that distribution maintainers work with, up to the design of the tools for users to upgrade their systems.

A number of Linux distributions have developed technologies to try to move beyond older release processes, implementing rolling releases and immutable systems so that developers can continuously release new software packages and systems can safely receive these updates. The Serpent OS project develops a complete set of tools for building both software packages and operating systems that will use these packages.

These Serpent OS tools are integrated into the Linux distribution called Serpent OS. This distribution is intended to be both a testing ground for the Serpent OS tools and a high-quality operating system for software developers. In future, the Serpent OS tools will hopefully be part of other, new distributions that are intended for other roles. For example, there is currently work being done to build a distribution for mobile devices.

The Serpent OS tooling is actually specifically designed to be reused by other teams to create their own Linux distibutions, and to enable these distribution teams to continuously collaborate. Today, many of the most popular Linux distributions rely on other distributions to provide them with the tools and package definitions that they need, but the technologies that they share were not designed to support this kind of reuse. Solus, Serpent OS and other distributions that use the Serpent OS tooling will be able to quickly and routinely share their work.

## Why does this matter?

The short answer is that it might make your life better. If you rely on computers, it matters that the systems that you use will respond to your needs, and that they are trustworthy. To have confidence, you need systems that are both easy to operate and transparent. That confidence is built from many small things, and can also be spoiled by even a small number of decisions by the software maintainers that you rely on.

The design of Serpent OS tooling makes it easy for developers to get the small things right, and enables multiple teams of developers to efficiently maintain operating systems that are tailored to suit the needs of particular users. If Serpent OS does not meet your needs, you can use Solus or another distribution and still benefit from the same technologies.

The bigger picture is that we all need to be able to update our systems more quickly and with more confidence than ever before. Old software has become unsafe software as the rate of new security vulnerabilities increases. We can also expect to have go through large transitions as we replace some of the software and hardware that we currently use with other products that are safer and more efficient by design.

Serpent OS is arguably becoming the best set of open technologies that we have for making operating systems that we can gracefully maintain and evolve into the future.
