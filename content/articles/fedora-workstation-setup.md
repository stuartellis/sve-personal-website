A guide to setting up [Fedora Workstation](https://fedoraproject.org/workstation/) for DevOps and software development.

## Installation

### Enable Disk Encryption

Enable disk encryption when prompted during the setup process.

Disk encryption is the only protection against anyone with physical access to your
computer. All other security measures will be completely bypassed if someone with
physical access either restarts your computer with a bootable pen drive, or removes the
internal hard drive and attaches it to another computer.

### Set a Password for UEFI or BIOS

Once you have installed Fedora, restart your computer, and press the function key to
enter the setup menu for the UEFI firmware, or BIOS. Change the boot options so that the
computer only boots from the hard drive, and set both a user password for startup, and
an administrator password to protect the firmware menus.

## Do This First

Log in once, run the Software utility, and ensure that the operating system has
the latest updates. After all of the updates have been applied, restart the computer.

## User Settings

Select _Settings \> Privacy & Security_. Check these settings:

- Always set _Thunderbolt Access_ to _Only USB and Display Port devices can attach._ unless you know that you need to connect other types of devices to your computer.
- Set _Location \> Automatic Device Location_ to off.
- Adjust the _File History & Wastebasket_ settings if you need to.

## Installing Desktop Applications with Flatpak

[Flatpak](https://flatpak.org) is now the standard for desktop software packages on Linux. Flatpak offers newer versions of products than Fedora itself, as well as providing software that is not available from Fedora RPM repositories, such as Slack.

The Software utility uses the [Flathub](https://flathub.org/) service for Flatpak packages. Software shows both Flatpak and RPM packages for apps. If a Flatpak is available, use that package rather than RPM.

{{< alert >}}
Install code editors and IDEs with RPM packages, not Flatpak. Currently, security features for Flatpak may prevent application plugins from working correctly.
{{< /alert >}}

Useful software that you can install as Flatpaks include:

- [Beekeeper Studio](https://www.beekeeperstudio.io) for working with databases
- [Draw.io](https://www.drawio.com/) for drawing diagrams
- [Joplin](https://joplinapp.org/) for note-taking

## Setting Up for Development

### Text Editors

Fedora includes the command-line editor [nano](https://www.nano-editor.org/) and a small version of [vim](http://www.vim.org/) with a limited set of features, as well as a
desktop text editor with basic support for programming. Add the code editors or IDEs that you would prefer to use.

If you do not have a preferred editor, consider using a version of [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com). To work with a modern Vim editor, install [Neovim](https://neovim.io).

#### Visual Studio Code

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) is a powerful desktop editor for programming, with built-in support for version control and debugging. The large range of extensions for Visual Studio Code enable it to work with every popular programming language and framework. It is available free of charge.

The Microsoft releases of Visual Studio Code are proprietary software with telemetry enabled by default, and download extensions from a proprietary Microsoft app store. if you have issues or concerns about the Microsoft releases, use the RPM packages that are provided by the [vscodium](https://vscodium.com) project.

{{< alert >}}
Extensions may fail if you use the [Visual Studio Code OSS](https://flathub.org/apps/details/com.visualstudio.code.oss) Flatpak.
{{< /alert >}}

#### Neovim

If you would like a modern Vim editor with a good default configuration, set up Neovim. To install Neovim, enter this command in a terminal window:

```shell
sudo dnf install neovim
```

#### Setting The EDITOR Environment Variable

Whichever text editor you choose, remember to set the EDITOR environment variable in
your _~/.bashrc_ file, so that this editor is automatically invoked by command-line
tools like your version control system. For example, put this line in your profile to
make Visual Studio Code the favored text editor:

```shell
export EDITOR="code"
```

### Configuring Git

Fedora Workstation includes the [Git version control system](http://www.git-scm.com/). Always set your details for Git before you create or clone repositories on a new system. This requires two commands in a terminal window:

```shell
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "you@your-domain.com"
```

The _global_ option means that the setting will apply to every repository that you work
with in the current user account.

To enable colors in the output, which can be very helpful, enter this command:

```shell
git config --global color.ui auto
```

Add a GPG key to Git before you commit to shared projects. The next section explains how to do this.

### Using a GPG Key

Always use [GPG](https://gnupg.org/) to sign the commits that you make in code repositories, especially for shared projects like Open Source software. This means that each commit can be linked to the author.

To create a GPG key, run the _gpg_ command in a terminal window. For example:

```shell
gpg --full-gen-key
```

GPG will prompt you for several options. Use these values:

- Select the _RSA and RSA_ algorithm
- Choose a key length of _4096_
- Accept the default option to have no expiration date for your key
- Enter the same email address that you will use for code hosting sites, such as Codeberg or GitHub

Once you have created a GPG key, configure Git to use it.

First get the ID of the key:

```shell
gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format=long
```

This displays an output like this:

```shell
pub   rsa4096/C36CB86CB86B3716 2022-01-18 [SC]
      BF18AC2876178908D6E71267D36CB86CB86B3716
uid                 [ultimate] Anne Example <anne@example.org>
sub   rsa4096/B7BB94F0C9BA6CAA 2022-01-18 [E]
```

In this example, the key ID is _C36CB86CB86B3716_.

Next, configure Git to use this key:

```shell
git config --global user.signingkey C36CB86CB86B3716
git config --global commit.gpgsign true
```

Finally, add your GPG key to your accounts on code hosting services that you use:

- [Codeberg](https://docs.codeberg.org/security/gpg-key/)
- [GitLab](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/signed_commits/gpg.html#add-a-gpg-key-to-your-account)
- [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/adding-a-gpg-key-to-your-github-account)

If you use multiple code hosting services for your projects, use the same GPG key for all of them. This ensures that copies of the same commits can be verified everywhere.

### Setting Up A Directory Structure for Projects

To keep your projects tidy, I would recommend following these guidelines. They may seem
slightly fussy, but they pay off when you have many projects, some of which are on
different version control hosts.

First create a top-level directory with a short, generic name like _repos_. For each repository host, create a subdirectory in _repos_. Add a subdirectory that matches your username. The final directory structure looks like this:

```text
repos/
    codeberg.org/
        my-codeberg-username/
            a-project/
    gitlab.com/
        my-gitlab-username/
            a-project/
            another-project/
```

### Creating SSH Keys

You may use SSH to access Git repositories or remote UNIX systems. Fedora includes the standard OpenSSH suite of tools.

To create an SSH key, run the _ssh-keygen_ command in a terminal window. For example:

```shell
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "Me MyName (MyDevice) <me@mydomain.com>"
```

Create a separate SSH key for each set of systems that you access.

## Setting Up Homebrew

The [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) package management system provides the latest versions of tools. Always use Homebrew to install tools that are frequently updated, like the [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) and [Trivy](https://aquasecurity.github.io/trivy).

Follow the instructions on the Homebrew site to install it.

To check that Homebrew is installed correctly, run this command in a terminal window:

```shell
brew doctor
```

To update the index of available packages, run this command in a terminal window:

```shell
brew update
```

## Working with Programming Languages

Avoid using the Fedora packages for programming languages. Instead, use version manager tools. These enable you to install the correct version of the required programming language and dependencies for each of your projects. Use Homebrew to install version manager tools.

Alternatively, Fedora Workstation includes [toolbx](https://containertoolbx.org/) to help you manage container environments for developing your projects. Container environments also enable you to have separate versions of software for each of your projects.

### Using Version Managers

Consider using a specialized version manager for these programming languages:

- [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) for Python
- [rustup](https://rustup.rs/) for Rust
- The standard _go_ tool [manages versions of Go](https://go.dev/doc/manage-install#installing-multiple).
- [tenv](https://tofuutils.github.io/tenv/) for Terraform or OpenTofu

You can start using these version managers quickly. They require very little configuration.

[mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) is more powerful. It acts as a version manager for multiple programming languages. This is most useful for JavaScript, as it provides a consistent set of features for managing many tools, including Node.js, Deno and Bun.

Use Homebrew to install the version managers that you need. If you use a version manager, you will also need to install compiler tools for the C programming language. Installations of Python, Node.js and other languages use GCC to compile components that are written in C. To provide GCC use the Fedora packages for GCC:

```shell
sudo dnf install gcc
```

We use the GCC compiler for this purpose because it is compatible with the widest range of C code. If you are developing your own C code, consider using the [Clang](https://clang.llvm.org/) compiler for your project.

### Terraform and OpenTofu

Use the [tenv](https://tofuutils.github.io/tenv/) version manager to install versions of Terraform and OpenTofu. To install _tenv_ with Homebrew, run this command in a terminal window:

```shell
brew install tenv cosign
```

Always install _cosign_ along with _tenv_. If _cosign_ is present, _tenv_ automatically uses it to carry out signature verification on the binaries that it downloads.

### Avoid Using The System Python Installation

Fedora includes an installation of Python 3, which is used by system tools. Avoid using this system installation yourself. Instead, manage your own installations of Python with containers or version managers, as explained in the previous section.

## Working with Containers

Fedora Workstation automatically has support for running containers with [Podman](https://podman.io/). This provides the features of Docker for running container images. It also includes [toolbx](https://containertoolbx.org/), which uses containers to manage environments for developing your projects.

To use a graphical interface for working with containers, add [Podman Desktop](https://podman-desktop.io) to your system. To install Podman Desktop, go to _Software_, search for _Podman Desktop_, select the entry from the list, and choose _Install_.

To create container images, install [buildah](https://buildah.io). This command-line tool provides the same features as Docker for building container images.

### Using Podman

Podman replaces [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) for running container images, and also has additional features to integrate better with both the Linux operating system and Kubernetes. For example, [you can run Podman containers as standard system services](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/quadlet-podman).

Podman accepts the same syntax as the _docker_ command-line tool, and will read Dockerfiles. Both Docker and Podman use the OCI image format, so that images created either product will work with the other. By default, Podman will check the Docker public registry for container images, as well as [Quay](https://quay.io/) registries.

For convenience, define a shell alias in your _.bashrc_ file:

```shell
alias docker="podman"
```

This will redirect any call to Docker, so that it uses Podman instead.

The [Usage Transfer](https://github.com/containers/libpod/blob/master/transfer.md) page lists Docker commands, and the equivalents for Podman. [This article](https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2019/02/21/podman-and-buildah-for-docker-users/) explains the relationship between Podman, Buildah and Docker in more detail.

{{< alert >}}
Use [pods](https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2019/01/15/podman-managing-containers-pods/) to run groups of containers. This feature of Podman replaces _docker\-compose_.
{{< /alert >}}

If you need to run existing Docker Compose configurations, install _podman-compose_:

```shell
sudo dnf install podman-compose
```

The _podman compose_ subcommand uses _podman-compose_ to substitute for Docker Compose.

This enables you to convert Docker Compose configurations into Podman pod definitions at a later time. Use pods to benefit from the features of Podman, such as systemd integration and the facility to generate Kubernetes configurations from pod definitions.

## Working with Virtual Machines

Fedora Workstation installs [GNOME Boxes](https://apps.gnome.org/en-GB/Boxes/) by default, to enable you to create and manage virtual machines. GNOME Boxes provides a graphical interface for the standard KVM and QEMU software. You can also use these tools directly on the command-line.

## SQL Databases

Consider using containers to provide the database services for your Web applications.
This will enable you to use different versions of the database servers for different
projects, and ensure that you are running the same versions as the database instances on
your production systems.

If you prefer to install services directly on to your workstation, Fedora provides
packages for [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) and [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/). If you need a database
server that is compatible with MySQL, install MariaDB. Otherwise, PostgreSQL is often a
better choice for new applications.

### Installing PostgreSQL

To install PostgreSQL using _dnf_, enter these commands in a terminal window:

```shell
sudo dnf install postgresql-server
sudo postgresql-setup --initdb
sudo systemctl enable postgresql
sudo systemctl start postgresql
```

These commands install the server, the command-line tools, and the client libraries that
are needed to compile adapters for programming languages.

To create a user account for yourself in PostgreSQL with administrative rights, enter
this command in a terminal window:

```shell
sudo su - postgres
createuser -s YOU
exit
```

Replace _YOU_ with the username of your account on Fedora.

The _-s_ option means that your new PostgreSQL account is a _superuser_, with unlimited
rights over the databases. Once you have a superuser account, you may use tools like
_createuser_ or log in to databases without using sudo or the _-U_ option.

For example, to create an extra user account that is not a superuser:

```shell
createuser EXTRA-ACCOUNT
```

Replace _EXTRA-ACCOUNT_ with the username of the new account.

Refer to the [Fedora documentation](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/quick-docs/postgresql/) for more
information on working with PostgreSQL.
