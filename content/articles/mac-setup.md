A guide to setting up an Apple Mac for DevOps and software development.

If you are thinking of switching to Linux, I also provide a [guide for setting up Fedora Workstation for development and DevOps](https://www.stuartellis.name/articles/fedora-workstation-setup/). Fedora is consistently the highest quality Linux desktop distribution.

## Do This First

Log in once, go to _System Settings_ and use _Software Update_ to ensure that the operating system is at the latest
point release. After all of the updates have been applied, restart the computer.

## Configuring a User Account

Log in again and create an Admin user account for your use. If other people will be
using the machine, create Standard accounts for them. Log out of the initial account,
and log in to the Admin account that you have just created.

Always log in with this new Admin account. The benefit of leaving the initial account
untouched is that it ensures that you always have a working account to login with.

{{< alert >}}
_Admin accounts have sudo privileges:_ All Admin accounts on a Mac may use sudo to run command-line utilities with administrative (root) privileges.
{{< /alert >}}

### Securing the Safari Browser

Whether or not you regularly use Safari, you should open it once, and adjust the
settings in case that you use it later.

First, choose _Safari \> Settings \> General_ and deselect the option _Open “safe” files after downloading_.

Second, go to _Safari \> Settings \> Search_. Decide which search engine that you want to use. Ensure that _Include search engine suggestions_, _Include Safari Suggestions_ and _Preload Top Hit in the background_ are not enabled.

## Configuring Security

Apple provide quite secure operating systems, but unfortunately convenience has won out
over security in a few places. These can easily be corrected by changing a few settings.
If you are using a laptop then make all of these changes as soon as possible.

### Security & Privacy

Select _System Settings \> Privacy & Security_.

- Select _Analytics & Improvements_ and ensure that the options are not enabled.
- Select _Apple Advertising_ and ensure that _Personalised Ads_ is set to _off_.
- Ensure that _Allow accessories to connect_ is set to _Ask for New Accessories_.
- Choose _Advanced..._ and select _Require an administrator password to access systemwide settings_.

### Lock Screen

- Set _require password after screen saver begins or display is turned off_ to _Immediately_.
- Set _Show password hints_ to _off_.

### Network

- Ensure that _Firewall_ is _Active_.

### Enable File Vault NOW

File Vault is a full-disk encryption system. You should enable File Vault
_NOW_, because it is the only protection against anyone with physical access to your
computer. All other security measures will be completely bypassed if someone with
physical access simply restarts the computer with a bootable pen drive.

{{< alert >}}
File Vault really is secure, which means that you can permanently lose access to your data if you lose the passwords and the recovery key.
{{< /alert >}}

### Set a Firmware Password

Set a password to stop access to the
[Recovery](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201314) mode. Otherwise, any malicious
individual can change the firmware settings to boot from a disc or device of their
choosing. If you did not enable File Vault, then the attacker will have complete access
to all of the files on the system.

[Apple Knowledge Base article HT204455](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT204455)
provides full details.

### Setting Up Time Machine Backups

Time Machine is simple to set up. Just take a suitably large external hard drive, plug it
in to your Mac, and agree when prompted. The drive setup process will reformat the hard
drive. The only settings that may need to change are the exclusions.

Choose _System Preferences \> Time Machine_, and click _Options_. Add to the exclusions
list any folders that contain ISO disk images, virtual machines, or database files (such
as Outlook). If the external hard drive is short of space, exclude the _System_
folder.

## Setting Up for Development

The first step is to install the _Command Line Tools for Xcode_. Once you have installed Command Line Tools, you can use
[Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) to install everything else that you need.

### Getting Xcode

Apple now provide the Xcode suite as a free download from the App Store. To install the Command Line Tools, install Xcode from the App Store, then open a Terminal window and enter the following command:

```shell
xcode-select --install
```

If you want to install just the Command Line Tools, you can download a package from [the Apple Developer Downloads site](https://developer.apple.com/download/all/).

### Setting Up Homebrew

[Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) provides a package management system for macOS. It enables you
to quickly install the tools and libraries that you need and regularly update all of them. Always use Homebrew for tools that have frequently have new releases, like the [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) and [Trivy](https://aquasecurity.github.io/trivy).

To install Homebrew, download and open the latest PKG file from [the Releases on GitHub](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/releases/latest).

You should also amend your PATH, so that the versions of tools that are installed with
Homebrew take precedence over others. To do this, edit the file _.zshrc_ in
your home directory to include this line:

```shell
export PATH="/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:~/bin:$PATH"
```

You need to close all of your terminal windows for this change to take effect.

To check that Homebrew is installed correctly, run this command in a terminal window:

```shell
brew doctor
```

To update the index of available packages, run this command in a terminal window:

```shell
brew update
```

To upgrade all the packages that you have installed, run this command in a terminal window:

```shell
brew upgrade
```

### Enabling Auto Completion of Commands

Many command-line tools provide automatic completion of commands. These include Git, curl and the AWS command-line tool. Homebrew installs the files for each command-line tool that provides completion, but it does not enable automatic completion in your shell.

To enable auto completion, edit the file _.zshrc_ in your home directory to include this line:

```bash
autoload bashcompinit && bashcompinit
```

Close all of the Terminal windows. Every new Terminal window will support autocompletion.

To use auto completion, type the name of the command, and press the Tab key on your keyboard. You will see a list of possible completions. Press the Tab key to cycle through the completions, and press the Enter key to accept a completion.

### Installing the Git Version Control System

The Xcode Command Line Tools include a copy of [Git](http://www.git-scm.com/), but this will be out of date.

To install a newer version of Git than Apple provide, use Homebrew. Enter this command in a terminal window:

```shell
brew install git
```

If you do not use Homebrew, go to the [Web site](http://www.git-scm.com/) and follow the
link for _Other Download Options_ to obtain a macOS disk image. Open your downloaded
copy of the disk image and run the enclosed installer in the usual way, then dismount
the disk image.

Always set your details before you create or clone repositories on a new system. This
requires two commands in a terminal window:

```shell
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "you@your-domain.com"
```

The _global_ option means that the setting will apply to every repository that you work
with in the current user account.

To enable colors in the output, which can be very helpful, enter this command:

```shell
git config --global color.ui auto
```

Add a GPG key to Git before you commit to shared projects. The next section explains how to do this.

### Using a GPG Key

Always use [GPG](https://gnupg.org/) to sign the commits that you make in code repositories, especially for shared projects like Open Source software. This means that each commit can be linked to the author.

To install GPG on macOS, use Homebrew.

```shell
brew install gnupg
brew install pinentry-mac
```

To create a GPG key, run the _gpg_ command in a terminal window. For example:

```shell
gpg --full-gen-key
```

GPG will prompt you for several options. Use these values:

- Select the _RSA and RSA_ algorithm
- Choose a key length of _4096_
- Accept the default option to have no expiration date for your key
- Enter the same email address that you will use for code hosting sites, such as Codeberg or GitHub

Once you have created a GPG key, configure Git to use it.

First get the ID of the key:

```shell
gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format=long
```

This displays an output like this:

```shell
pub   rsa4096/C36CB86CB86B3716 2022-01-18 [SC]
      BF18AC2876178908D6E71267D36CB86CB86B3716
uid                 [ultimate] Anne Example <anne@example.org>
sub   rsa4096/B7BB94F0C9BA6CAA 2022-01-18 [E]
```

In this example, the key ID is _C36CB86CB86B3716_.

Next, configure Git to use this key:

```shell
git config --global user.signingkey C36CB86CB86B3716
git config --global commit.gpgsign true
```

Finally, add your GPG key to your accounts on code hosting services that you use. Here are links to the documentation for some popular code hosting services:

- [Codeberg](https://docs.codeberg.org/security/gpg-key/)
- [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/adding-a-gpg-key-to-your-github-account)
- [GitLab](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/signed_commits/gpg.html#add-a-gpg-key-to-your-account)

If you use multiple code hosting services for your projects, use the same GPG key for all of them. This ensures that copies of the same commits can be verified everywhere.

### Setting Up A Directory Structure for Projects

To keep your projects tidy, I would recommend following these guidelines. They may seem
slightly fussy, but they pay off when you have many projects, some of which are on
different version control hosts.

First create a top-level directory with a short, generic name like _repos_. For each repository host, create a subdirectory in _repos_. Add a subdirectory that matches your username. The final directory structure looks like this:

```text
repos/
    codeberg.org/
        my-codeberg-username/
            a-project/
    gitlab.com/
        my-gitlab-username/
            a-project/
            another-project/
```

### Text Editors

Installations of macOS include a command-line version of [vim](http://www.vim.org/) and TextEdit, a desktop text editor. TextEdit is designed for light-weight word processing, and it has no support for programming. Add the code editors or IDEs that you would prefer to use.

If you do not have a preferred editor, consider using a version of [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com). Read the next section for more details.

To use a modern code editor that works like Vim, install [Neovim](https://neovim.io). The default configuration for Neovim follows best practices for Vim, but you can customise it as you wish.

#### Visual Studio Code

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) is a powerful desktop editor for programming, with built-in support for version control and debugging. The large range of extensions for Visual Studio Code enable it to work with every popular programming language and framework. It is available free of charge.

The Microsoft releases of Visual Studio Code are proprietary software with telemetry enabled by default, and download extensions from a proprietary Microsoft app store. if you have issues or concerns about the Microsoft releases, use the packages that are provided by the [vscodium](https://vscodium.com) project.

#### Setting The EDITOR Environment Variable

Whichever text editor you choose, remember to set the EDITOR environment variable in
your _~/.zshrc_ file, so that this editor is automatically invoked by command-line
tools like your version control system. For example, put this line in your profile to
make Visual Studio Code the favored text editor:

```shell
export EDITOR="code"
```

### Creating SSH Keys

You may use SSH to access Git repositories or remote UNIX systems. macOS includes the standard OpenSSH suite of tools.

OpenSSH stores your SSH keys in a _.ssh_ directory. To create this directory, run these commands in a terminal window:

```shell
mkdir $HOME/.ssh
chmod 0700 $HOME/.ssh
```

To create an SSH key, run the _ssh-keygen_ command in a terminal window. For example:

```shell
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "Me MyName (MyDevice) <me@mydomain.com>"
```

Create a separate SSH key for each set of systems that you access.

## Programming Languages

Avoid using the installations of programming languages that are included in macOS. Instead, use version manager tools. These enable you to use the correct versions and dependencies for each project that you work on. Follow the advice in the sections below to install version managers for popular programming languages with Homebrew.

If possible, avoid using Homebrew itself to install programming languages. Homebrew has limited support for working with multiple versions of the same programming language.

### Python Development: pyenv and pipx

The copy of Python 3 that is supplied with macOS is never the latest version of Python. Use either [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) or [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) to install newer versions of Python. Both of these tools enable you to use multiple versions of Python.

To install pyenv with Homebrew, run this command in a terminal window:

```shell
brew install pyenv
```

Use [pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/) to install Python applications, rather than _pip_ or Homebrew. To set up _pipx_, run these commands in a terminal window:

```shell
brew install pipx
pipx ensurepath
```

### Rust Development: rustup

The official _rustup_ utility enables you to install the tools for building software
with the Rust programming language. Click on the Install button on the front page of the
[Rust Website](https://www.rust-lang.org), and follow the instructions.

By default, the installer adds the correct directory to your path. If this does not
work, add this to your PATH manually:

```shell
$HOME/.cargo/bin
```

This process installs all of the tools into your home directory, and does not add any files into system directories.

### JavaScript Development: Node.js

Use [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) to manage your Node.js installations.

### Go Development

Use Homebrew to install the _go_ tool. To install [Go](https://go.dev/) with Homebrew, enter this command:

```shell
brew install golang
```

This provides the standard command-line tool for Go. The _go_ tool includes support for working with [multiple versions of Go](https://go.dev/doc/manage-install#installing-multiple).

#### Setting a GOPATH

Current versions of Go do not require a GOPATH environment variable, but you should set it to ensure that third-party tools and Terminal auto-completion work correctly.

Set a GOPATH environment variable in your _~/.zshrc_ file:

```shell
export GOPATH="$HOME/go"
```

Then, add this to your PATH:

```shell
$GOPATH/bin
```

Close the Terminal and open it again for the changes to take effect.

### Java Development: Adoptium

#### Which Version of Java?

Many vendors provide a JDK. To avoid licensing and support issues, use Eclipse Temurin. This is an Open Source JDK that is maintained by the [Adoptium](https://adoptium.net/) project. The versions of Java on the OpenJDK Website are for testers, and the Oracle JDK is a proprietary product. Use the _LTS_ version of Temurin, unless you need features that are in the latest releases.

Use either [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) or the [jEnv](https://www.jenv.be/) version manager to work with multiple JDKs.

Once you have installed a JDK, get the [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org) build tool. This is provided by the Maven project itself, and is not part of Temurin or the OpenJDK.

#### Manual Set up of Eclipse Temurin

To manually install a copy of the JDK:

1. Download the version of the JDK that you need from Adoptium
2. Unzip the download
3. Copy the JDK directory to _/usr/local/lib_
4. Edit your _~/.zshrc_ file to set environment variables. For example, to use jdk-11.0.3+7 as the Java version:

```shell
JAVA_HOME=/usr/local/lib/jdk-11.0.3+7/Contents/Home
PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/lib/jdk-11.0.3+7/Contents/Home/bin
```

To manually install a copy of [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org):

1. Download the latest version of Maven
2. Unzip the download
3. Copy the Maven directory to _/usr/local/lib/_
4. Add _/usr/local/lib/MAVEN-DIRECTORY_ to your PATH environment variable

Replace _MAVEN-DIRECTORY_ with the name of the directory that Maven uses, such as _apache-maven-3.6.0_.

Maven is written in Java, which means that the project provides one package, which works on any operating system that has a supported version of Java.

#### Setting up jEnv

Run this command in a terminal window to install [jEnv](https://www.jenv.be/):

```shell
brew install jenv
```

Next, add this to your PATH:

```shell
$HOME/.jenv/bin
```

Add this to your _~/.zshrc_ file:

```shell
eval "$(jenv init -)"
```

Open a new terminal window, and run this command:

```shell
jenv enable-plugin export
```

This enables jEnv to manage the JAVA_HOME environment variable.

To avoid inconsistent behaviour, close all the terminal windows that you currently have open. The jEnv utility will work correctly in new terminal windows.

Lastly, run this command to register your current JDK with jEnv:

```shell
jenv add $(/usr/libexec/java_home)
```

To see a list of the available commands, type _jenv_ in a terminal window:

```shell
jenv
```

### Terraform and OpenTofu

Use the [tenv](https://tofuutils.github.io/tenv/) version manager to install versions of Terraform and OpenTofu. To install _tenv_ with Homebrew, run this command in a terminal window:

```shell
brew install tenv cosign
```

Always install _cosign_ along with _tenv_. If _cosign_ is present, _tenv_ automatically uses it to carry out signature verification on the binaries that it downloads.

## Databases

Consider using containers to run the databases that you need. If you prefer to install services
directly on to your workstation, Homebrew provides packages for PostgreSQL, MariaDB, MySQL and the [Community Edition of MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x/).

### Installing PostgreSQL

To install PostgreSQL using Homebrew, enter this command in a terminal window:

```shell
brew install postgresql
```

This command installs the server, the command-line tools, and the client libraries that
are needed to compile adapters for programming languages.

Homebrew also provides some commands for managing your PostgreSQL installation. For
example, to start the server, follow the instructions that are displayed after the
installation process is completed. If you upgrade your copy of PostgreSQL, you should
use the _postgresql-upgrade-database_ command that Homebrew gives you.

### Installing MariaDB or MySQL

To install MariaDB using Homebrew, enter this command in a terminal window:

```shell
brew install mariadb
```

To install MySQL using Homebrew, enter this command in a terminal window:

```shell
brew install mysql
```

These commands install the server, the command-line tools, and the client libraries that
are needed to compile adapters for programming languages. To start the server, follow
the instructions that are displayed after the installation process is completed.

{{< alert >}}
For compatibility, MariaDB uses the same names for command-line tools as MySQL.
{{< /alert >}}

Remember to set a password for the root accounts. First, login with the _mysql_
command-line utility:

```shell
mysql -u root -q
```

{{< alert >}}
_The -q Option Disables Command History:_ By default, the command-line client stores the full text of every command in a history file. If you know that you are going to run statements that include passwords or other sensitive data, use the -q option.
{{< /alert >}}

Run these statements to change the password for root access:

```sql
UPDATE mysql.user SET password = PASSWORD('yourpassword') WHERE user
LIKE ‘root’;
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
EXIT;
```

You now need a password to login to the installation as root. To login with root again,
use this command:

```shell
mysql -u root -p
```

Enter the password when prompted.

You should also remove the anonymous accounts and test database that MySQL automatically
includes:

```sql
DROP DATABASE test;
DELETE FROM mysql.user WHERE user = ’’;
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

If you intend to duplicate a production environment for testing, create a configuration
file on your Mac. Production installations of MySQL should be configured with
appropriate _SQL modes_ to enable data integrity safeguards. By default, MySQL permits
various types of invalid data to be entered.

### Database Management Tools

To work with SQL databases, use [Beekeeper Studio](https://www.beekeeperstudio.io). This graphical tool supports the popular Open Source databases, as well as Microsoft SQL Server and Amazon Redshift. This enables you to use the same tool for all of your databases.

Install Beekeeper with Homebrew:

```shell
brew install --cask beekeeper-studio
```

Each vendor recommends a specific graphical tool for their particular database product. These are the tools that the vendors suggest:

- [Azure Data Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/sql/azure-data-studio/what-is?view=sql-server-2017) - Microsoft tool for SQL Server and Azure databases
- [Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/products/compass) - The official tool for MongoDB
- [MySQL Workbench](http://wb.mysql.com/) - The official tool for MySQL
- [Oracle SQL Developer](https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/appdev/sql-developer.html) - The official tool for Oracle
- [pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/) - The recommended tool for PostgreSQL

## Other Useful Desktop Applications for Developers

- [Joplin](https://joplinapp.org/) note-taking: _brew install \--cask joplin_
- [LibreOffice](http://www.libreoffice.org/) suite: _brew install \--cask libreoffice_
