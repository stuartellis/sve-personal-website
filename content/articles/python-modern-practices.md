[Python](https://www.python.org/) has a long history, and it has evolved over time. This article describes some agreed modern best practices.

## Use a Helper to Run Python Tools

Use either [pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io) or [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) to run Python tools on development systems, rather than installing these applications with _pip_ or another method. Both _pipx_ and _uv_ automatically put each application into a separate [Python virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html).

> Always follow the instructions on the [Website](https://pipx.pypa.io) to install _pipx_ on your operating system. This will ensure that _pipx_ works correctly with an appropriate Python installation.

Use the [pipx run](https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/#walkthrough-running-an-application-in-a-temporary-virtual-environment) feature of _pipx_ for most Python applications, or [uvx](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/#tool-management), which is the equivalent command for _uv_. These download the application to a cache and run it. For example, these commands download and run the latest version of [bpytop](https://github.com/aristocratos/bpytop), a system monitoring tool:

```shell
pipx run bpytop
```

```shell
uvx bpytop
```

The _bpytop_ tool is cached after the first download, which means that the second use of it will run as quickly as an installed application.

Use _pipx install_ or _uv tool install_ for tools that are essential for your development process. These options install the tool on to your system. This ensures that the tool is available if you have no Internet access, and that you keep the same version of the tool until you decide to upgrade it.

For example, install [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/), rather than use a temporary copy. The _pre-commit_ tool automatically runs every time that we commit a change to version control, so we want it to be consistent and always available. To install _pre-commit_, run the appropriate command for _pipx_ or _uv_:

```shell
pipx install pre-commit
```

```shell
uv tool install pre-commit
```

## Using Python for Development

### Avoid Using the Python Installation in Your Operating System

If your operating system includes a Python installation, avoid using it for your projects. This Python installation is for system tools. It is likely to use an older version of Python, and may not include all of the standard features. An operating system copy of Python should be [marked](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/externally-managed-environments/#externally-managed-environments) to prevent you from installing packages into it, but not all operating systems set this marker.

### Install Python With Tools That Support Multiple Versions

Instead of manually installing Python on to your development systems with packages from [the Python Website](https://www.python.org), use a version manager tool like [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev) or [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv). These tools allow you to switch between different versions of Python. This means that you can upgrade each of your projects to new versions of Python later without interfering with other tools and projects that use Python. I provide a separate [article on using version managers](https://www.stuartellis.name/articles/version-managers/).

Alternatively, consider using [Development Containers](https://containers.dev/), which are a feature of Visual Studio Code and Jetbrains IDEs. Development Containers enable you to define an isolated environment for a software project, which means that it will have a completely separate installation of Python.

Whichever tool you use, ensure that it compiles Python, rather than downloading [standalone builds](https://gregoryszorc.com/docs/python-build-standalone/main/). These standalone builds are modified versions of Python that are maintained by [Astral](https://astral.sh/), not the Python project.

Both the pyenv tool and the [Visual Studio Code Dev Container feature](https://github.com/devcontainers/features/blob/main/src/python/README.md) automatically compile Python, but you must [change the mise configuration](https://mise.jdx.dev/lang/python.html#precompiled-python-binaries) to use compilation.

> Only use the Python installation features of [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), [PDM](https://pdm-project.org) and [Hatch](https://hatch.pypa.io) for experimental projects. These project tools always download third-party standalone builds of Python when a user requests a Python version that is not already installed on the system.

### Use a Project Tool

Choose a project tool for Python. There are several of these tools, each of which provides the same essential features. For example, all of these tools can generate a directory structure that follows best practices and will be compatible with other Python tooling.

[Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) is currently the most popular tool for Python application projects. Consider using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) or [PDM](https://pdm-project.org) for new application projects. PDM and _uv_ align more closely to the latest Python standards.

If you are developing a Python library, you may prefer to use [Hatch](https://hatch.pypa.io). Hatch provides a well-integrated set of features for building and testing Python packages.

> _Avoid using [Rye](https://rye.astral.sh/)_. Rye has been superseded by _uv_.

Some Python projects have specialized requirements that mean that you will decide to create a customised project, rather than using a popular project tool. In these cases, think carefully about the tools and directory structure that you will need, and ensure that you are familiar with the current [best practices for Python projects](https://www.stuartellis.name/articles/python-project-setup).

### Use the Most Recent Version of Python That You Can

For new projects, choose the most recent stable version of Python 3. This ensures that you have the latest security fixes, as well as the fastest performance.

Upgrade your projects as new Python versions are released. The Python development team usually support each version for five years, but some Python libraries may only support each version of Python for a shorter period of time. If you use tools that support multiple versions of Python and automated testing, you can test your projects on new Python versions with little risk.

_Avoid using Python 2._ Older operating systems include Python 2, but it is not supported by the Python development team or by the developers of most popular Python libraries.

## Developing Python Projects

### Format Your Code

Use a formatting tool with a plugin to your editor, so that your code is automatically formatted to a consistent style.

Consider using [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/), which provides both code formatting and quality checks for Python code. [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) was the most popular code formatting tool for Python before the release of Ruff.

Use [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to run the formatting tool before each commit to source control. You should also run the formatting tool with your CI system, so that it rejects any code that does not match the format for your project.

### Use a Code Linter

Use a code linting tool with a plugin to your editor, so that your code is automatically checked for issues.

[flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) has been the most popular linter for Python, but consider using [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/). Ruff includes the features of both flake8 and the most popular plugins for flake8, along with many other capabilities.

Use [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to run the linting tool before each commit to source control. You should also run the linting tool with your CI system, so that it rejects any code that does not meet the standards for your project.

### Use Type Hinting

Current versions of Python support type hinting. Consider using type hints in any critical application. If you develop a shared library, use type hints.

Once you add type hints, type checkers like [mypy](http://www.mypy-lang.org/) can check your code as you develop it. Code editors will read type hints to display information about the code that you are working with. You can also add a type checker to your pre-commit hooks and CI to validate that the code in your project is consistent.

If you use [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/) in your application, it can work with type hints. Use the [mypy plugin for Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/integrations/mypy/) to improve the integration between mypy and Pydantic.

> [PEP 484 - Type Hints](https://peps.python.org/pep-0484/) and [PEP 526 â€“ Syntax for Variable Annotations](https://peps.python.org/pep-0526/) define the notation for type hinting.

### Test with pytest

Use [pytest](http://pytest.org) for testing. Use the _unittest_ module in the standard library for situations where you cannot add _pytest_ to the project.

By default, _pytest_ runs tests in the order that they appear in the test code. To avoid issues where tests interfere with each other, always add the [pytest-randomly](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-randomly/) plugin to _pytest_. This plugin causes _pytest_ to run tests in random order. Randomizing the order of tests is a common good practice for software development.

To see how much of your code is covered by tests, add the [pytest-cov](https://pytest-cov.readthedocs.io) plugin to _pytest_. This plugin uses [coverage](https://coverage.readthedocs.io) to analyze your code.

### Package Your Projects

Always package the tools and code libraries that you would like to share with other people. Packages enable people to use your code with the operating systems and tools that they prefer to work with, and also allow them to manage which version of your code they use.

Use [wheel](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/binary-distribution-format/) packages to distribute the Python libraries that you create. Read the [Python Packaging User Guide](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/flow/) for an explanation of how to distribute software with wheel packages.

You can also use _wheel_ packages to share development tools. If you publish your Python application as a _wheel_, other developers can run it with _uv_ or _pipx_. All _wheel_ packages require an existing installation of Python.

For all other cases, package your applications in a format includes a copy of the required version of Python as well as your code and the dependencies. This will ensure that your code runs with the expected version of Python, and that it has the correct version of each dependency.

Use container images to package applications that provide a network service, such as a Web application. You can build OCI container images with Docker, [buildah](https://buildah.io/) and other tools. OCI container images can run on any system that uses Docker, Podman or Kubernetes, as well as on cloud infrastructure. Consider using the [official Python container image](https://hub.docker.com/_/python) as the base when you build images for your application.

Use [PyInstaller](https://pyinstaller.org/) to publish desktop and command-line applications as a single executable file. Each PyInstaller file includes a copy of Python, along with your code and the required dependencies.

> _Requirements files:_ If you use requirements files to build or deploy projects then configure your tools to [use hashes](#ensure-that-requirements-files-include-hashes).

### Ensure That Requirements Files Include Hashes

Python tools support [hash checking](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/topics/secure-installs/#hash-checking-mode) to ensure that packages are valid. Some tools require extra configuration to include package hashes in the requirements files that they generate. For example, you must set the _generate-hashes_ option for the _pip-compile_ and _uv_ utilities to generate _requirements.txt_ files that include hashes. Add this option to the relevant section of the _pyproject.toml_ file.

For _pip-tools_, add the option to the _tool.pip-tools_ section:

```toml
[tool.pip-tools]
# Set generate-hashes for pip-compile
generate-hashes = true
```

For _uv_, add the option to the _tool.uv.pip_ section:

```toml
[tool.uv.pip]
# Set generate-hashes for uv
generate-hashes = true
```

## Language Syntax

### Create Data Classes for Custom Data Objects

Python code frequently has classes for _data objects_: items that exist to store values, but do not carry out actions. If you are creating classes for data objects in your Python code, consider using either [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/) or the built-in [data classes](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html) feature.

Pydantic provides validation, serialization and other features for data objects. You need to define the classes for Pydantic data objects with type hints.

The built-in Python syntax for data classes offers fewer capabilities than Pydantic. The data class syntax does enable you to reduce the amount of code that you need to define data objects. Each data class acts as a standard Python class, because the syntax for data classes does not change the behavior of the classes that you define with it. Data classes also provide a limited set of features, such as the ability to mark instances of a data class as [frozen](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html#frozen-instances).

> [PEP 557](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0557/) describes data classes.

### Use enum or Named Tuples for Immutable Sets of Key-Value Pairs

Use the _enum_ type for immutable collections of key-value pairs. Enums can use class inheritance.

Python also has _collections.namedtuple()_ for immutable key-value pairs. This feature was created before _enum_ types. Named tuples do not use classes.

### Format Strings with f-strings

The new [f-string](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#f-strings) syntax is both more readable and has better performance than older methods. Use f-strings instead of _%_ formatting, _str.format()_ or _str.Template()_.

The older features for formatting strings will not be removed, to avoid breaking backward compatibility.

> [PEP 498](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0498/) explains f-strings in detail.

### Use Datetime Objects with Time Zones

Always use _datetime_ objects that are [aware](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html?highlight=datetime#aware-and-naive-objects) of time zones. By default, Python creates _datetime_ objects that do not include a time zone. The documentation refers to _datetime_ objects without a time zone as **naive**.

Avoid using _date_ objects, except where the time of day is completely irrelevant. The _date_ objects are always **naive**, and do not include a time zone.

Use aware _datetime_ objects with the UTC time zone for timestamps, logs and other internal features.

To get the current time and date in UTC as an aware _datetime_ object, specify the UTC time zone with _now()_. For example:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timezone

dt = datetime.now(timezone.utc)
```

Python 3.9 and above include the **zoneinfo** module. This provides access to the standard IANA database of time zones. Previous versions of Python require a third-party library for time zones.

> [PEP 615](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0615/) describes support for the IANA time zone database with **zoneinfo**.

### Use collections.abc for Custom Collection Types

The abstract base classes in _collections.abc_ provide the components for building your own custom collection types.

Use these classes, because they are fast and well-tested. The implementations in Python 3.7 and above are written in C, to provide better performance than Python code.

### Use breakpoint() for Debugging

This function drops you into the debugger at the point where it is called. Both the [built-in debugger](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html) and external debuggers can use these breakpoints.

The [breakpoint()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#breakpoint) feature was added in version 3.7 of Python.

> [PEP 553](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0553/) describes the _breakpoint()_ function.

## Application Design

### Use Logging for Diagnostic Messages, Rather Than print()

The built-in _print()_ statement is convenient for adding debugging information, but you should include logging in your scripts and applications. Use the [logging](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#logrecord-attributes) module in the standard library, or a third-party logging module.

### File Formats: TOML for Configuration & JSON for Data

Use [TOML](https://toml.io/) for configuration files that must be written or edited by human beings. Use the JSON format for data that is transferred between computer programs. Current versions of Python include support for both of these formats.

All of the versions of Python 3 includes [a module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html) for both reading and creating JSON. Python 3.11 and above include [tomllib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tomllib.html) to read the TOML format. If your Python software will generate TOML, you need to add [Tomli-W](https://pypi.org/project/tomli-w/) to your project.

Avoid using the INI or YAML formats for new projects. These formats are more difficult to validate with software, and human errors are also more likely. If you need to work with YAML, use [ruamel.yaml](https://pypi.org/project/ruamel.yaml/), rather than [PyYAML](https://pypi.org/project/PyYAML/). You should use version 1.2 of the YAML format, and PyYAML only supports YAML 1.1.

> [PEP 680 - tomllib: Support for Parsing TOML in the Standard Library](https://peps.python.org/pep-0680/) explains why TOML is now included with Python.

### Only Use async Where It Makes Sense

The [asynchronous features of Python](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html) enable a single process to avoid blocking on I/O operations. To achieve concurrency with Python, you must run multiple Python processes. Each of these processes may or may not use asynchronous I/O.

To run multiple application processes, either use a container system, with one container per process, or an application server like [Gunicorn](https://gunicorn.org/). If you need to build a custom application that manages multiple processes, use the [multiprocessing](https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html) package in the Python standard library.

Code that uses asynchronous I/O must not call _any_ function that uses synchronous I/O, such as _open()_, or the _logging_ module in the standard library. Instead, you need to use either the equivalent functions from _asyncio_ in the standard library or a third-party library that is designed to support asynchronous code.

The [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) Web framework supports [using both synchronous and asynchronous functions in the same application](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/async/). You must still ensure that asynchronous functions never call any synchronous function.

If you would like to work with _asyncio_, use Python 3.7 or above. Version 3.7 of Python introduced [context variables](https://docs.python.org/3/library/contextvars.html), which enable you to have data that is local to a specific _task_, as well as the _asyncio.run()_ function.

> [PEP 0567](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0567/) describes context variables.

## Libraries

### Handle Command-line Input with argparse

The [argparse](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html) module is now the recommended way to process command-line input. Use _argparse_, rather than the older _optparse_ and _getopt_.

The _optparse_ module is officially deprecated, so update code that uses _optparse_ to use _argparse_ instead.

Refer to [the argparse tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/argparse.html) in the official documentation for more details.

### Use pathlib for File and Directory Paths

Use [pathlib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html) objects instead of strings whenever you need to work with file and directory pathnames.

Consider using the [the pathlib equivalents for os functions](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html#correspondence-to-tools-in-the-os-module).

Methods in the standard library support Path objects. For example, to list all of the the files in a directory, you can use either the _.iterdir()_ function of a Path object, or the _os.scandir()_ function.

This [RealPython article](https://realpython.com/working-with-files-in-python/#directory-listing-in-modern-python-versions) provides a full explanation of the different Python functions for working with files and directories.

### Use os.scandir() Instead of os.listdir()

The _os.scandir()_ function is significantly faster and more efficient than _os.listdir()_. If you previously used the _os.listdir()_ function, update your code to use _os.scandir()_.

This function provides an iterator, and works with a context manager:

```python
import os

with os.scandir('some_directory/') as entries:
    for entry in entries:
        print(entry.name)
```

The context manager frees resources as soon as the function completes. Use this option if you are concerned about performance or concurrency.

The _os.walk()_ function now calls _os.scandir()_, so it automatically has the same improved performance as this function.

The _os.scandir()_ function was added in version 3.5 of Python.

> [PEP 471](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0471/) explains _os.scandir()_.

### Run External Commands with subprocess

The [subprocess](https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html) module provides a safe way to run external commands. Use _subprocess_ rather than shell backquoting or the functions in _os_, such as _spawn_, _popen2_ and _popen3_. The _subprocess.run()_ function in current versions of Python is sufficient for most cases.

> [PEP 324](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0324/) explains subprocess in detail.

### Use httpx for Web Clients

Use [httpx](https://www.python-httpx.org/) for Web client applications. Many Python applications include [requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), but you should httpx for new projects.

The httpx package supersedes requests. It supports [HTTP/2](https://www.python-httpx.org/http2/) and [async](https://www.python-httpx.org/async/), which are not available with requests.

Avoid using _urllib.request_ from the Python standard library. It was designed as a low-level library, and lacks the features of requests and httpx.
