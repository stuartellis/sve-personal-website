[YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) is an essential part of modern software development. It has been an established format for configurations for years, and is unlikely to be replaced for a long time to come. Many, many products now use YAML for configuration, from developer tools and continuous integration pipelines to tools for managing systems like Kubernetes and Ansible.

Ideally, we generate YAML files. This ensures that they are valid, correctly formatted and consistent. However, many YAML files are manually edited, even if they were originally generated by systems. This article describes some standard tools that help us maintain YAML documents, regardless of how they are created or changed.

All of these tools become most effective when they work automatically. We can run them in text editors and with pre-commit hooks that call them when we commit changes to version control. We should also run them in continuous integration pipelines. If they run in continuous integration, we ensure that all of the YAML files in a project are always maintained to the same standard.

## Formatting, Linting and Validating YAML

These tools will work on files that use standard YAML:

- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) - Formats many types of file, including YAML
- [yamllint](https://yamllint.readthedocs.io) - Lints YAML files
- [check-jsonschema](https://check-jsonschema.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) - Checks JSON and YAML files with identified types against their [schema](#validation-with-check-jsonschema)

You can run them with both Git hooks and on-demand by [using a pre-commit tool](#running-tools-with-prek-or-pre-commit). Since they are command-line tools, you can also run them as part of continuous integration pipelines.

> All of these tools have useful default configurations, so you only need to add configuration files if you need to customize their behavior.

Prettier and schemas also work in modern text editors. These editors can run Prettier on your code. They usually require a [plugin](https://prettier.io/docs/editors/), but [Zed has Prettier built-in](https://zed.dev/docs/languages/yaml?highlight=prettier#formatting). Editors use the same [schemas](#validation-with-check-jsonschema) as `check-jsonschema` for error checking and autocompletion.

### Formatting with Prettier

[Prettier](https://prettier.io/) formats files for a [wide range of programming languages and data types](https://prettier.io/docs/), including YAML. It is deliberately opinionated, so that every installation of Prettier formats files in exactly the same way, unless users decide to override it.

If your text editor supports Prettier and is configured to format YAML files on save then it works automatically. The Zed editor [has Prettier built-in](https://zed.dev/docs/languages/yaml?highlight=prettier#formatting). For other editors, the documentation for the Prettier plugin should explain how to set it up.

Automated code formatting improves software projects for no cost. When we apply the same formatter on every change, the format of the code becomes consistent and predictable, which enables us to rapidly refactor projects. Automatic code formatting also removes the need for commits that only format files.

### Linting with yamllint

The [yamllint](https://yamllint.readthedocs.io) tool ensures that files are valid YAML. It applies [rules](https://yamllint.readthedocs.io/en/stable/rules.html) that are designed for standard YAML.

If you have YAML files that are templates, you will need to provide a custom configuration for `yamllint`, or use a specialized tool for the files that are in that format, such as [cfn-lint](https://pypi.org/project/cfn-lint/) for CloudFormation. For Ansible, we do both: the [ansible-lint](https://ansible.readthedocs.io/projects/lint/) tool is intended to be used alongside `yamllint`.

> By design, `yamllint` ignores files with a double file extension, such as `.yaml.jinja`. These files are likely to be templates.

### Validation with check-jsonschema

The schemas for YAML formats are [JSON Schemas](https://json-schema.org/). Each schema is a JSON file that describes JSON or YAML. Vendors publish the schemas for their products to the [Schema Store](https://www.schemastore.org/). You can [create your own schemas](https://json-schema.org/learn/getting-started-step-by-step).

Modern text editors like Visual Studio Code, JetBrains IDEs, Neovim and Zed use JSON Schemas for autocompletion and error-checking. These editors download schemas for YAML files from the Schema Store, which means that both editors and tools like `check-jsonschema` apply the same rules.

> Visual Studio Code requires the [redhat.vscode-yaml](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-yaml) extension to support schemas for YAML.

The [check-jsonschema](https://check-jsonschema.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) tool checks YAML and JSON files against the relevant schema. It includes copies of schemas for popular tools and can use other schemas, including your own schemas. It also provides [hooks](https://check-jsonschema.readthedocs.io/en/stable/precommit_usage.html#supported-hooks).

## Running Tools with prek or pre-commit

The [prek](https://prek.j178.dev/) tool manages Git hooks and enables you to run the same actions at any time, not just when you commit changes. It can download the other runtimes and tools that the hooks need. This means that it can provide a cross-platform way to install and run a complete set of tools for formatting and checking code.

> The [prek](https://prek.j178.dev/) tool supersedes [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/). It can use hooks that are written for `pre-commit`, and works with existing `pre-commit` project configurations.

### Installing prek

To install `prek`, use either [pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io) or [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/):

```shell
pipx install prek
```

```shell
uv tool install prek
```

### Adding Hooks To a Project

The configuration must be in a file called `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file. Save this file in the root directory of your project:

```yaml
---
repos:
  - repo: builtin
    hooks:
      - id: trailing-whitespace
      - id: end-of-file-fixer
      - id: check-json
      - id: check-toml
      - id: check-yaml
      - id: check-added-large-files

  - repo: https://github.com/rbubley/mirrors-prettier
    rev: "v3.5.2"
    hooks:
      - id: prettier

  - repo: https://github.com/adrienverge/yamllint.git
    rev: "v1.37.1"
    hooks:
      - id: yamllint
        args: ["--strict"]

  - repo: https://github.com/python-jsonschema/check-jsonschema
    rev: "0.33.3"
    hooks:
      - id: check-github-workflows
      - id: check-taskfile
```

This configuration enables Prettier, `yamllint` and `check-jsonschema`. It also includes `check-yaml`, one of the standard hooks. This hook is redundant, and you might choose to remove it.

To activate the configuration, run `prek install`. This adds the hooks to the Git configuration for your copy of the project, so that the tools automatically run on the staged changes each time that you commit.

```shell
cd my-project
prek install
```

> Since the `prek` configuration file is YAML, it will automatically be formatted and checked by the same tools that `prek` runs itself.

### Using Hooks

The tools automatically run on the staged changes each time that you commit. To run a tool without commiting a change, use `precommit run`. If you add the option `--all-files` it will check the current files in the project, not just staged changes.

For example, to run the `check-github-workflows` hook on the project, use this command:

```shell
prek run check-github-workflows --all-files
```

To run all of the hooks on the project, use this command:

```shell
prek run --all-files
```

### Updating Hooks

To update all of the hooks to their current version, run this command:

```shell
prek auto-update
```

It automatically edits the `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file to update the versions of the hooks. You then commit this change to source control, so that other copies of the repository will use the same versions.
